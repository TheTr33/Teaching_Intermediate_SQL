    "\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN** takes all rows that exist in both tables (the intersection) based on the joined column key.\n",
    "- **LEFT JOIN** takes all rows from the LEFT table so the number of rows must be equal to the left table's. So this includes the intersection, but also any unique records to the left table. If you have selected some columns from the RIGHT table, but there are no related records in the left table, these records will show NULL values.\n",
